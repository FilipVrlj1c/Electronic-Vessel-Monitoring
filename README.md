# Electronic Vessel Monitoring System
Master's Thesis Project

This project was developed as part of my Master's thesis and focuses on creating an electronic monitoring system for vessels. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller with its built-in Wi-Fi chip to establish communication between the vessel and an operator located on the coast. The main objective is to monitor various specifications and statuses of the ship, including battery levels, sensor readings, and other relevant parameters, using a TCP router for data transmission.

Key Features:
ESP32-based system: Utilizes the powerful ESP32 microcontroller for reliable Wi-Fi communication.
Real-time monitoring: The system allows the operator on the coast to receive real-time updates about the vessel's conditions.
TCP communication: Data is transmitted over a TCP/IP network for seamless integration and monitoring.
Status checks: Includes monitoring of different specifications such as battery levels, sensors, and other important parameters.
This project combines hardware and software components to create an integrated IoT solution for vessel monitoring, providing real-time feedback for operators to ensure the safety and proper functioning of the ship.
